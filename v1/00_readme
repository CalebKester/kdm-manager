#			 A Note on naming conventions
#	All support modules, i.e. anything that will be imported by something else,
#	should have a file extension. Examples are anything named with a .py or a 
#	 .txt.

#	Anything that runs, e.g. a CGI or the 'init_script' script should NOT have
#	any extension. 


# Start from bare metal on deb/ubuntu (do this in order):
apt-get install python2.7 python-dev python-setuptools gcc python-imaging python-gridfs
apt-get install git mongodb-server
git clone ssh://toconnell@toconnell.info:222/~/git/kdm-manager
apt-get install nginx

# python dependencies
easy_install python-daemon psutil lockfile pymongo pydns validate-email user-agents xlwt

# finally
ln -s /home/toconnell/kdm-manager/v1/init_script /etc/init.d/kdm-manager
ln -s /home/toconnell/kdm-manager/v1/nginx/default kdm-manager_dev			# this makes kdm-manager the default webserver response
/etc/init.d/kdm-manager start


# running the init script for the first time should create the log and lockfile
# directories. it should also start the server on the port in settings.cfg
