# Before pushing a new production version

 - initialize the project on the dev server
 - create a new login
 - create a new settlement
 - add a survivor
 - modify both randomly
 - delete the survivor
 - delete the settlement

# A Note on naming conventions
All support modules, i.e. anything that will be imported by something else,
should have a file extension. Examples are anything named with a .py or a 
.txt.

Anything that runs, e.g. a CGI or the 'init_script' script should NOT have
any extension.
