Corrections and Fixes

 - Fixed typos in "Whistling Mace" and "Clutch Fighter".
 - Fixed an email normalization bug affecting sharing of Survivors. -Dennis Acc
 - Fixed a session-pruning bug that was causing tracebacks when a session was more than 24 hours old and had not already been pruned. This caused a 10-15 minute total outage this morning affecting three active sessions: sorry guys. -mncor
 - "Final Fighting Art", "Ultimate Weapon" and "Guidepost" are no longer always available.
 - Fixed a bug that allowed disorders to be added multiple times.
 - Adjusted the anchor tag placement on the Settlement Storage div; page refreshes during Storage load-in should be less disruptive.
 - "Add Fighting_art" on the Survivor view is now "Add Fighting Art".
 - Fixed the bug on the Settlement screen where Survivors looked clickable, but were not.
 - Users can no longer move Survivors that do not belong to them in and out of the Hunting Party.
 - Relatedly, non-admin users may no longer return the hunting party: only the Settlement creator/admin may return the entire hunting party (i.e. by using the button on the Campaign View).

 - Adjusted gear/resource tile colors (in Settlement Storage) for better visual differentiation.

Corrections and Fixes

 - Fixed typos re: White Lion set, Rawhide set, a couple of severe injuries and some other misc. things
 - Keyed in items for Weapon Crafter and Leather Worker (have fun storming the castle!) 
 - Fixed the new survivor creation form so it's impossible to submit it without survivor sex and trigger a traceback. -mew1997

 - Fixed the bug on the Settlement and Survivor forms where the "Save" button wouldn't save certain fields.

----
Improvements

 - Survivor form now tries to put you back to where you were after a refresh. -Leky, UncleSquamous, et al.
 - Created game asset classes for Fighting Arts and Disorders as part of general refactoring; implementing biz logic re: FAs will be easier/faster.
 - Fully deprecated the one-off rendering functions for game assets. (This has no visible frontend effect, but makes things way easier on the backend.)
 - The dropdown to remove fighting arts and Disorders from survivors who have none is hidden; the dropdown that adds FAs and Disorders to survivors goes away after they have three; remove existing FAs/disorders to add more. -Leky, mew1997
 - Adding disorders such as "Secretive" that require the survivor to skip the next hunt will toggle "Skip Next Hunt" on for the survivor. 
 - Population and Death Count in the Campaign view now reflect the settlement's min pop/min death count, based on survivors created.

Corrections and Fixes

 - Fixed the bug that caused a traceback if you permanently deleted a Settlement that had only one Survivor
 - Fixed the bug that caused resources to show up in the location picker. -Leky
 - Corrected "Memento Mori" to "Momento Mori" and fixed the consequences bug associated with that Innovation. -Leky
 - Innovations are now sorted alphabetically. -Leky
 - Always available innovations now include Lantern Oven, Language, Final Fighting Art, Ultimate Weapon, Guidepost and Ammonia. -Leky,ForgedIron
 - Toggling "Dead" or "Retired" no longer reloads the Survivor edit form.

----
Improvements
----
 - Added the change log
 - Reloading the Settlement form takes you back to where you were (or as close as possible). Similar functionality for the Survivor form is coming soon.
 - Rewrote the logic that determines which innovations are considered "always available". Making corrections should be faster going forward.
 - Styled the "Skip Next Hunt" button so that it wraps nicer and looks less cluttered when a survivor has abilities and impairments.
 - Added a new game asset class for Abilities and Impairments (i.e. to be order to use it for business logic in the future).
 - Keyed in the permanent injury impairments from the severe injuries table and added a dropdown selector for them. -Leky
 - Added settlement locations to the Campaign summary view
 - A number of dropdowns, including the location picker and the quarry picker, are now dynamic (i.e. only show you what you can add) and will disappear from the Settlement form when available options are exhausted. -Leky
 - Settlement Storage now auto-sorts into "gear", "resources" and "other" groups ("other" is where your custom gear/resources go for now). This should help you deal cards out a little bit faster.
 - Improved exception handling while creating sessions and rendering views. In all but the most extreme cases, exceptions will automatically end the user's session, allowing him to authenticate again and try to start from the dashboard.


----
Coming soon
----
